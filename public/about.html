<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Rop Pavlow, and I grew up in a small village in Slovakia. Life in the village was simple and peaceful, surrounded by nature and close-knit community. As a child, I was more interested in playing outside and exploring the countryside than in technology or computers.</p>
  
  However, as I entered my teenage years, my curiosity about computers and the digital world began to grow. I started spending more time learning about how they worked and experimenting with different software. Despite my growing interest, I didn't pursue a formal education in computer science after high school. 
  
 <p>Main reason was my lack of self-confidence. I was quite introverted and often doubted my abilities. The idea of attending university and competing with others who seemed more knowledgeable and outgoing was daunting. Instead, I chose a different path, focusing on self-study and learning at my own pace.</p>
  
  Over the years, I have continued to develop my skills and knowledge in information technology. I've taken online courses, participated in forums, and worked on personal projects. This journey has taught me that passion and perseverance can lead to success, even without a traditional educational background.</p>
  
 
 <p>Today, I am proud of the progress I've made and the person I've become. My experiences have shaped me into a more confident and capable individual, ready to take on new challenges and continue growing in the field of technology.</p>
